# Implement AI Caching System

* **Status**: Draft
* **Date**: 2025-08-10

## Context

The AI provider integration was performing redundant analysis on code changes that had already been analyzed previously. This resulted in unnecessary API calls, increased latency, and wasted computational resources. The system lacked a mechanism to detect when a specific set of file changes had already been processed, leading to repeated analysis of identical diffs. Additionally, the analysis was including documentation files in the `docs/` directory, which were not relevant for architectural decision validation but were contributing to the redundant processing overhead.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive caching system that maps file diff fingerprints to their corresponding AI analysis results. The system will generate unique identifiers for each set of code changes, store analysis results keyed by these fingerprints, and check the cache before making new AI provider requests. The caching mechanism will exclude documentation files and focus on tracking changes to source code and configuration files that impact architectural decisions.

## Rationale

After evaluating the performance bottlenecks in our AI-powered validation workflow, implementing a caching layer emerged as the most straightforward solution to eliminate redundant analysis. The fingerprint-based approach ensures that identical code changes are never analyzed twice, while the exclusion of documentation files reduces noise in the cache and focuses on architecturally significant changes. This solution directly addresses the core inefficiency without requiring major architectural changes to the existing AI provider integration.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Eliminates redundant AI API calls for previously analyzed code changes
- Reduces latency in git hook validation workflows
- Decreases computational costs associated with AI provider usage
- Improves developer experience by providing faster feedback on repeated changes
- Enables offline operation for previously cached analysis results

### Negative

- Introduces additional complexity in the codebase with cache management logic
- Requires disk storage for cache persistence, which may grow over time
- Adds potential failure points in cache read/write operations
- May mask issues if cache becomes inconsistent with actual analysis needs

### Neutral

- Cache storage location and retention policies will need ongoing management
- System behavior becomes dependent on cache state and integrity
- Additional configuration options for cache management increase operational complexity

## Alternatives Considered

The team explored other approaches but determined that the caching solution was the only viable option to implement given the current architecture and constraints. Alternative approaches were not extensively documented as part of this decision process.
